				 	I can program in html5, CSS, and JavaScript. I still have a lot to learn but I have a good understanding of  each programming language. However there is always more to learn because I am far from being a master. Although I don't see it as my future career, I like it and I think It will a valuable life skill.
				    <br><br>
					 I have been playing the trumpet for 7 years and love it. Although I'm not great considering how long I've been playing, I do play first trumpet in my schools marching band. Once again it is something that i love, but is not what I want to do with life.Like everything else I am no master so I'm always striving to do better.
				     <br><br>
					 I love learning! Now don't get this mixed up because when I say that I love learning I DO NOT mean I love school. Sometimes the two have absolutely nothing to do with each other. Anyway I'm good at math and science mostly because it interests me and I actually want to learn about it. Right now I'm taking AP Calculus and AP Biology. Ultimately I think that I want to do something with chemistry for a career because it combines what I'm good at (math) with what I love (science).

						One of my past projects was making a pseudo cookie clicker with my own code and design. I chose to go with a pokemon theme by replacing cookies with pokeballs. This "Poke-Clicker" worked very similarly to its cookie counterpart.
